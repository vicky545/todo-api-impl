# TODO API Impl - Docker Compose

This project includes a `docker-compose.yml` (MySQL service) to run a local database for development.

Quick usage on Windows:

- Make sure Docker Desktop is installed: https://www.docker.com/get-started
- Use the modern command `docker compose` (space) where possible. Some systems also support the legacy `docker-compose` command.
